# Peer Conferences

The [Association for Software Testing](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org) supports and promotes peer conferences through its [grant program](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/programs/ast-grant-program/). 

This repository contains resources that we think will be helpful to anyone running, or thinking of running, a peer conference. In particular, [Peers Exchanging Ideas: The AST Peer Conference Guide](AST_Peer_Conference_Guide.md) covers setting up a conference team, working out what you want from your conference, setting the conference up, running it, and then reflecting on how it went.

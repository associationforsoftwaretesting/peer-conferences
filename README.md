# Peer Conferences

The [Association for Software Testing](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org) supports and promotes peer conferences through its [grant program](https://www.associationforsoftwaretesting.org/programs/ast-grant-program/). 

This repository contains resources that we think will be helpful to anyone running, or thinking of running, a peer conference.
